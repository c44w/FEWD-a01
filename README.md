## I also love squids and other cephalopods
### I'm not a fan of SeaWorld
Hi there, I'm **Chris**! I am a learning _**web-developer and designer**_. Being an aquatic mammal is both challenging and rewarding. The fact that I'm a dolphin who knows how to type and use GitHub makes me believe I can do anything, therefore I plan to take over the world one day. But don't worry, I won't retaliate against the human species. 
  
Free Willy is my favorite movie. I prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones. My ancestors were actually land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order, and I'm related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which my more recent ancestors split approximately 48 million years ago.
  
These are some things I do:
* Figuring out what to do with my life
* Bodysurf
* Random things
  
Here's a picture of me swimming with my friends:
